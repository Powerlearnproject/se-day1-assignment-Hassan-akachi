○ Milestone: The development of high-level programming languages like
FORTRAN and COBOL.
○ Impact: These languages made programming more accessible, reducing the
complexity of writing machine-level code and enabling the development of more
complex software systems.
2. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):
○ Milestone: The introduction of structured programming concepts, such as control
structures and modular design.
○ Impact: Structured programming improved code readability, reduced errors, and
laid the foundation for modern software development practices.3. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s):
○ Milestone: The adoption of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like
C++ and Java.
○ Impact: OOP introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism, which allowed for more reusable, maintainable, and scalable
code.
3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life
Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) typically includes the following phases:
1. Requirement Analysis:
○ Gathering and analyzing the requirements from stakeholders to define what the
software should do.
2. Design:
○ Creating architectural and detailed designs that outline how the software will be
built, including database schemas, user interfaces, and system interactions.
3. Implementation or development (Coding):
○ Writing the actual code based on the design documents to develop the software.
4. Testing:
○ Verifying that the software works as intended by performing various tests to
identify and fix bugs.
5. Deployment:
○ Releasing the software to the production environment where it will be used by
end-users.
6. Maintenance:
○ Providing ongoing support to fix issues, improve performance, and add new
features based on user feedback.
4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide
examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:
●
●
●
Sequential Phases: Follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase
(requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed
before the next begins.
Documentation-Driven: Emphasizes thorough documentation and planning upfront.
Best Suited For: Projects with well-defined requirements and little likelihood of change,
such as government contracts or safety-critical systems.Agile Methodology:
●
●
●
Iterative Development: Involves iterative cycles called sprints, where small parts of the
software are developed, tested, and reviewed.
Customer Collaboration: Emphasizes continuous customer feedback and adaptability
to changing requirements.
Best Suited For: Projects with dynamic requirements, where customer feedback and
quick iterations are crucial, such as software startups or web application development.
5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality
Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering
team.
Software Developer:
● Responsibilities: Writing code, implementing features, debugging, and collaborating
with other developers to build the software according to the design specifications.
Key Role: They are primarily responsible for the technical aspects of software
development.
● Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
● Responsibilities: Designing, executing, and automating tests to ensure that the
software meets quality standards and is free of defects.
● Key Role: They focus on identifying bugs and ensuring the software performs well under
various conditions.
● Project Manager:

● Responsibilities: Overseeing the project, managing the timeline, budget, and
resources, and ensuring that the team meets project goals and deadlines.
● Key Role: They act as the bridge between the technical team and stakeholders,
ensuring that the project stays on track.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process.
Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):

● Importance: IDEs provide a comprehensive environment with tools like code editors,
debuggers, and compilers, making it easier for developers to write, test, and debug
code.
● Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.Version Control Systems (VCS):

● Importance: VCS allows teams to track changes to the codebase, collaborate on code,
and manage different versions of the software. It helps prevent conflicts and ensures that
previous versions can be restored if needed.
● Examples: Git (with GitHub), Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers?
Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common Challenges:
1. Managing Changing Requirements:
○ Strategy: Adopt Agile practices to accommodate changes iteratively.
2. Dealing with Technical Debt:
○ Strategy: Regularly refactor code and prioritize code quality over quick fixes.
3. Ensuring Cross-Team Collaboration:
○ Strategy: Use collaboration tools like Slack and JIRA, and hold regular meetings
to align teams.
4. Handling Project Deadlines:
○ Strategy: Break down tasks into manageable sprints and use project
management tools to track progress.
8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and
acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing:
○ Definition: Tests individual components or functions in isolation.
○ Importance: Ensures that each part of the software works as intended.
2. Integration Testing:
○ Definition: Tests the interactions between different components or systems.
○ Importance: Verifies that components work together correctly.
3. System Testing:
○ Definition: Tests the complete integrated software system.
○ Importance: Ensures that the entire system meets the specified requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing:
○ Definition: Tests the software from the user’s perspective to ensure it meets
business requirements.
○ Importance: Determines whether the software is ready for release.Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with
AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts (input queries) to
effectively interact with AI models, such as language models like GPT. The goal is to craft
prompts that yield the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses from the AI.
Importance:

● Accuracy: Well-crafted prompts can lead to more accurate and contextually appropriate
responses from AI models.
● Efficiency: Effective prompts reduce the need for multiple iterations, saving time and
computational resources.
● Customization: By refining prompts, users can guide the AI to generate outputs tailored
to specific needs or preferences.
2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it
clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more
effective.
●Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about AI."
●Improved Prompt:
"Explain the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning in AI, including
examples of each."
●Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear and specific about what
aspect of AI the user wants to learn about (supervised vs. unsupervised learning) and
requests examples, which leads to a more detailed and relevant response.
